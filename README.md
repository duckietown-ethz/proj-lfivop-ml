# Robust Object Detection in Duckietown (proj-lfivop-ml)
Welcome to AMoD 2019 - Robust object detection repository! Two main sections of this repository include:
1. [dt-object-detection-training](https://github.com/duckietown-ethz/proj-lfivop-ml/tree/master/dt-object-detection-training): details the steps to train our object detection models from scratch
2. [googlecoral-duckiebot](https://github.com/duckietown-ethz/proj-lfivop-ml/tree/master/googlecoral-duckiebot): details the steps to run our finalized object detection models in Duckiebot with Google Coral USB accelerator
